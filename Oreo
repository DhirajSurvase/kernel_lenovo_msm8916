Most probably this commit set will work on all devices which fall under LA.BR.x.x.x CAF tag

Needed changes to be done in Defconfig (Saved kernel config) found under kernel-dir/arch/arm64(Mine is an arm64 device in this case for arm just remove '64')/configs/ 

Add/Enable Following configs:

-> Important
CONFIG_PROC_DEVICETREE=y
CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES="binder,hwbinder"
CONFIG_QUOTA=y
# CONFIG_PRINT_QUOTA_WARNING is not set
# CONFIG_DEVPORT is not set

-> Optional
